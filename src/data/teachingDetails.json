        "The prophecy of the first angel’s message, brought to view in Revelation 14, found its fulfillment in the advent movement of 1840-44. In both Europe and America, men of faith and prayer were deeply moved as their attention was called to the prophecies, and, tracing down the Inspired Record, they saw convincing evidence that the end of all things was at hand. The Spirit of God urged His servants to give the warning. Far and wide spread the message of the everlasting gospel, “Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come.” Revelation 14:7.",
        "Wherever missionaries had penetrated, were sent the glad tidings of Christ’s speedy return. In different lands were found isolated bodies of Christians, who, solely by the study of the Scriptures, had arrived at the belief that the Saviour’s advent was near. In some portions of Europe, where the laws were so oppressive as to forbid the preaching of the advent doctrine, little children were impelled to declare it, and many listened to the solemn warning.",
        "To William Miller and his co-laborers it was given to preach the message in America, and the light kindled by their labors shone out to distant lands. God sent His angel to move upon the heart of a farmer who had not believed the Bible, to lead  him to search the prophecies. Angels of God repeatedly visited that chosen one, to guide his mind and open to his understanding prophecies which had ever been dark to God’s people. The commencement of the chain of truth was given to him, and he was led on to search for link after link, until he looked with wonder and admiration upon the Word of God. He saw there a perfect chain of truth. That Word, which he had regarded as uninspired, now opened before his vision in its beauty and glory. He saw that one portion of Scripture explains another, and when one passage was closed to his understanding, he found in another part of the Word that which explained it. He regarded the sacred Word of God with joy, and with the deepest respect and awe",
        "As he followed down the prophecies he saw that the inhabitants of the earth were living in the closing scenes of this world’s history; yet they knew it not. He looked at the churches, and saw that they were corrupt; they had taken their affections from Jesus and placed them on the world; they were seeking for worldly honor, instead of that honor which cometh from above; grasping for worldly riches, instead of laying up their treasure in heaven. He could see hypocrisy, darkness, and death everywhere. His spirit was stirred within him. God called him to leave his farm, as He called Elisha to leave his oxen and the field of his labor to follow Elijah",
        "With trembling, William Miller began to unfold to the people the mysteries of the kingdom of God, carrying his hearers down through the prophecies to the second advent of Christ. The testimony of the Scriptures pointing to the coming of Christ in 1843 awakened widespread interest. Many were convinced that the arguments from the prophetic periods were correct,  and, sacrificing their pride of opinion, they joyfully received the truth. Some ministers laid aside their sectarian views and feelings, left their salaries and their churches, and united in proclaiming the coming of Jesus.",
        "There were but few ministers, however, who would accept this message; therefore it was largely committed to humble laymen. Farmers left their fields, mechanics their tools, traders their merchandise, professional men their positions; and yet the number of workers was small in comparison with the work to be accomplished. The condition of an ungodly church and a world lying in wickedness burdened the souls of the true watchmen, and they willingly endured toil, privation, and suffering, that they might call men to repentance unto salvation. Though opposed by Satan, the work went steadily forward, and the advent truth was accepted by many thousands."

        "Unabii wa ujumbe wa malaika wa kwanza, unaoonekana katika Ufunuo 14, ulipata utimilifu wake katika vuguvugu la marejeo la mwaka 1840-44. Katika Ulaya na Amerika, watu wa imani na maombi waligushwa sana wakati fikira zao zilipoelekezwa kwenye unabii, na, wakifuatilia Kumbukumbu Iliyovuviwa, waliona ushahidi wa kusadikisha kwamba mwisho wa mambo yote ulikuwa karibu. Roho wa Mungu aliwahimiza watumishi Wake kutoa onyo. Ujumbe wa injili ya milele ulienea mbali na kote, ukisema, 'Mcheni Mungu, na kumtukuza; kwa maana saa ya hukumu yake imekuja.' Ufunuo 14:7.",
        "Kila mahali ambapo wamisionari walikuwa wamefika, habari njema za kurudi upesi kwa Kristo zilitumwa. Katika nchi mbalimbali kulipatikana makundi ya Wakristo yaliyojitenga, ambao, kwa kujifunza Maandiko pekee, walikuwa wamefikia imani kwamba kuja kwa Mwokozi kulikuwa karibu. Katika baadhi ya sehemu za Ulaya, ambapo sheria zilikuwa za kidikteta kiasi cha kukataza uandishi wa fundisho la marejeo, watoto wadogo walisukumwa kulitangaza, na wengi walisikiliza onyo hilo zito.",
        "Kwa William Miller na wafanyakazi wenzake ilitolewa kazi ya kuhubiri ujumbe huo huko Amerika, na nuru iliyowashwa na kazi zao iliangaza hadi nchi za mbali. Mungu alimtuma malaika Wake kugusa moyo wa mkulima ambaye hakuwa ameiamini Biblia, ili kumwongoza kuchunguza unabii. Malaika wa Mungu walimtembelea mteule huyo mara kwa mara, ili kuongoza akili yake na kufunua ufahamu wake kwenye unabii ambao ulikuwa umekuwa giza kwa watu wa Mungu. Mwanzo wa mnyororo wa ukweli ulitolewa kwake, naye aliongozwa kutafuta kiungo baada ya kiungo, hadi alipotazama kwa mshangao na kustaajabu Neno la Mungu. Aliona hapo mnyororo kamili wa ukweli. Neno hilo, ambalo alikuwa ameliona kama lisilovuvuwa, sasa lilifunguka mbele ya maono yake katika uzuri na utukufu wake. Aliona kwamba sehemu moja ya Maandiko inaelezea nyingine, na wakati fungu moja lilipokuwa limefungwa kwa ufahamu wake, alipata katika sehemu nyingine ya Neno jambo lililolielezea. Alilitazama Neno takatifu la Mungu kwa furaha, na kwa heshima na unyenyekevu mkuu.",
        "Alipokuwa akifuatilia unabii huo, aliona kwamba wenyeji wa dunia walikuwa wakiishi katika matukio ya kufunga ya historia ya ulimwengu huu; lakini hawakujua. Aliyatazama makanisa, na kuona kwamba yalikuwa yameharibika; walikuwa wameondoa upendo wao kwa Yesu na kuuweka kwenye ulimwengu; walikuwa wakitafuta heshima ya kidunia, badala ya heshima ile itokayo juu; wakitafuta utajiri wa kidunia, badala ya kujiwekea hazina mbinguni. Aliweza kuona unafiki, giza, na mauti kila mahali. Roho yake ilisisimka ndani yake. Mungu alimwita auache shamba lake, kama alivyomwita Elisha awaache ng'ombe wake na shamba la kazi yake ili amfuate Eliya.",
        "Kwa kutetemeka, William Miller alianza kuwafunulia watu siri za ufalme wa Mungu, akiwapeleka wasikilizaji wake kupitia unabii hadi kwenye kuja kwa mara ya pili kwa Kristo. Ushuhuda wa Maandiko ukiashiria kuja kwa Kristo mnamo 1843 uliamsha maslahi makubwa. Wengi walisadiki kwamba hoja kutoka kwa vipindi vya unabii zilikuwa sahihi, na, wakidhabihu kiburi chao cha maoni, walipokea ukweli kwa furaha. Baadhi ya wachunguzi waliweka kando mitazamo na hisia zao za kimadhehebu, waliacha mishahara yao na makanisa yao, na kuungana katika kutangaza kuja kwa Yesu.",
        "Walakini, walikuwa wachungaji wachache tu ambao wangekubali ujumbe huu; kwa hivyo ulikabidhiwa kwa kiasi kikubwa kwa walei wanyenyekevu. Wakulima waliondoka mashambani mwao, mafundi waliacha vifaa vyao, wafanyabiashara bidhaa zao, wasomi nafasi zao; na bado idadi ya wafanyakazi ilikuwa ndogo kulinganisha na kazi iliyopaswa kukamilika. Hali ya kanisa lisiloacha dhambi na ulimwengu uliolala katika uovu ililemea roho za walinzi wa kweli, nao walivumilia kwa hiari taabu, upungufu, na mateso, ili wapate kuwaita watu kwenye toba kuelekea wokovu. Ingawa walipingwa na Shetani, kazi iliendelea mbele kwa uthabiti, na ukweli wa marejeo ulikubaliwa na maelfu mengi."

Like John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ, the preachers laid the ax at the root of the tree and urged all to bring forth fruit meet for repentance. Their stirring appeals were in marked contrast to the assurances of peace and safety that were heard from popular pulpits, and wherever the message was given, it moved the people.",
        "The simple, direct testimony of the Scriptures, set home by the power of the Holy Spirit, brought a weight of conviction which few were able wholly to resist. Professors of religion were roused from their false security. They saw their backslidings, their worldliness and unbelief, their pride and selfishness. Many sought the Lord with repentance and humiliation. The affections  that had so long clung to earthly things they now fixed upon heaven. The Spirit of God rested upon them, and with hearts softened and subdued they joined to sound the cry, “Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come.” Revelation 14:7",
        "Sinners inquired with weeping, “What must I do to be saved?” Those whose lives had been marked with dishonesty were anxious to make restitution. All who found peace in Christ longed to see others share the blessing. The hearts of parents were turned to their children, and the hearts of children to their parents. The barriers of pride and reserve were swept away. Heartfelt confessions were made, and the members of the household labored for the salvation of those who were nearest and dearest",
        "Often was heard the sound of earnest intercession. Everywhere were souls in deep anguish, pleading with God. Many wrestled all night in prayer for the assurance that their own sins were pardoned, or for the conversion of their relatives or neighbors. That earnest, determined faith gained its object. Had the people of God continued to be thus importunate in prayer, pressing their petitions at the mercy seat, they would be in possession of a far richer experience than they now have. There is too little prayer, too little real conviction of sin; and the lack of living faith leaves many destitute of the grace so richly provided by our gracious Redeemer.",
        "All classes flocked to the Adventist meetings. Rich and poor, high and low, were, from various causes, anxious to hear for themselves the doctrine of the second advent. The Lord held the spirit of opposition in check while His servants explained the reasons of their faith. Sometimes the instrument was feeble; but  the Spirit of God gave power to His truth. The presence of holy angels was felt in these assemblies, and many were daily added to the believers. As the evidences of Christ’s soon coming were repeated, vast crowds listened in breathless silence to the solemn words. Heaven and earth seemed to approach each other. The power of God would be felt upon old and young and middle-aged. Men sought their homes with praises upon their lips, and the glad sound rang out upon the still night air. None who attended those meetings can ever forget those scenes of deepest interest."

Kama Yohana Mbatizaji, mtangulizi wa Kristo, wahubiri waliweka shoka kwenye shina la mti na kuwahimiza wote kutoa matunda yapatanayo na toba. Miito yao yenye kusisimua ilikuwa tofauti kabisa na hakikisho za amani na usalama zilizosikika kutoka kwenye mimbari maarufu, na kila mahali ambapo ujumbe huo ulitolewa, uliwatikisa watu.",

Waliokiri dini waliamshwa kutoka kwenye usalama wao wa uongo. Waliona kurudi kwao nyuma, kupenda ulimwengu na kutokuamini kwao, kiburi chao na ubinafsi wao. Wengi walimtafuta Bwana kwa toba na unyenyekevu. Upendo ambao kwa muda mrefu ulikuwa umeng’ang’ania mambo ya duniani sasa waliuweka mbinguni. Roho wa Mungu alikaa juu yao, na kwa mioyo iliyolainishwa na kunyenyekezwa, waliungana kutoa ule ukelele, 'Mcheni Mungu, na kumtukuza; kwa maana saa ya hukumu yake imekuja.' Ufunuo 14:7",

Vizuizi vya kiburi na kujitenga vilifutwa. Ungamo la dhati lilifanywa, na washiriki wa kaya walifanya kazi kwa ajili ya wokovu wa wale waliokuwa karibu na wapendwa wao zaidi.",

Imani hiyo ya dhati na yenye azimio ilipata lengo lake. Kama watu wa Mungu wangeendelea kuwa na kusihi huko katika maombi, wakishinikiza maombi yao kwenye kiti cha rehema, wangekuwa na uzoefu tajiri zaidi kuliko ule walio nao sasa. Kuna maombi kidogo sana, ushawishi mdogo sana wa kweli wa dhambi; na ukosefu wa imani hai unawaacha wengi wakiwa fukara wa neema iliyoandaliwa kwa wingi na Mwokozi wetu mwenye neema.",

Tajiri na maskini, wakubwa na wadogo, walikuwa, kwa sababu mbalimbali, na hamu ya kujisikilia wenyewe fundisho la kuja kwa mara ya pili. Bwana alizuia roho ya upinzani wakati watumishi Wake walipokuwa wakieleza sababu za imani yao. Wakati mwingine chombo kilikuwa dhaifu; lakini Roho wa Mungu alitoa nguvu kwa ukweli Wake. Uwepo wa malaika watakatifu ulihisiwa katika makusanyiko haya, na wengi waliongezwa kila siku kwenye idadi ya waamini. Ushahidi wa kuja upesi kwa Kristo ulipokaririwa, umati mkubwa wa watu ulisikiliza kwa kimya kikuu maneno hayo mazito. Mbingu na nchi vilionekana kukaribiana. Nguvu ya Mungu ilihisiwa juu ya wazee, vijana, na watu wa makamo. Watu walirudi majumbani mwao kwa sifa midomoni mwao, na sauti hiyo ya furaha ilivuma katika hewa tulivu ya usiku. Hakuna yeyote aliyehudhuria mikutano hiyo anayeweza kusahau matukio hayo ya kuvutia sana."

They closed their ears to the clear and harmonious explanation of the text by those who were pointing to the close of the prophetic periods and to the signs which Christ Himself had foretold as tokens of His advent.",
        "Many who professed to love the Saviour declared that they had no opposition to the preaching of His coming; they merely objected to the definite time. God’s all-seeing eye read their hearts. They did not wish to hear of Christ’s coming to judge the world in righteousness. They had been unfaithful servants, their works would not bear the inspection of the heart-searching God, and they feared to meet their Lord. Like the Jews at the time of Christ’s first advent, they were not prepared to welcome Jesus. Satan and his angels exulted and flung the taunt in the face of Christ and holy angels, that His professed people had so little love for Him that they did not desire His appearing.",
        "Unfaithful watchmen hindered the progress of the work of God. As the people were roused, and began to inquire the way of salvation, these leaders stepped in between them and the truth, seeking to quiet their fears by falsely interpreting the Word of God. In this work Satan and unconsecrated ministers united, crying, Peace, peace, when God had not spoken peace. Like the Pharisees in Christ’s day, many refused to enter the kingdom of heaven themselves, and those who were entering in they hindered. The blood of these souls will be required at their hand.",
        "Wherever the message of truth was proclaimed, the most humble and devoted in the churches were the first to receive it. Those who studied the Bible for themselves could but see the unscriptural character of the popular views of prophecy, and wherever the people were not deceived by the efforts of the clergy to misstate and pervert the faith, wherever they would search the Word of God for themselves, the advent doctrine needed only to be compared with the Scriptures to establish its divine authority.",
        "Many were persecuted by their unbelieving brethren. In order to retain their position in the church, some consented to be silent in regard to their hope, but others felt that loyalty to God forbade them thus to hide the truths which He had committed to their trust. Not a few were cut off from the fellowship of the church for no other reason than expressing their belief in the coming of Christ. Very precious to those who bore the trial of their faith were the words of the prophet, “Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for My name’s sake, said, Let the Lord be glorified: but He shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.” Isaiah 66:5.",
        "Angels of God were watching with the deepest interest the result of the warning. When the churches as a body rejected the message, angels turned away from them in sadness. Yet there were in the churches many who had not yet been tested in regard to the advent truth. Many were deceived by husbands, wives, parents, or children, and were made to believe it a sin even to listen to such heresies as were taught by the Adventists. Angels were bidden to keep faithful watch over these souls; for another light was yet to shine upon them from the throne of God."

Hata hivyo, kulikuwa na wengi makanisani ambao walikuwa bado hawajajaribiwa kuhusiana na ukweli wa marejeo. Wengi walidanganywa na waume, wake, wazazi, au watoto, na kufanywa waamini kuwa ni dhambi hata kusikiliza mafundisho hayo ya kigeni kama yale yaliyofundishwa na Waadventista. Malaika waliamriwa kuendelea kuwalinda kwa uaminifu watu hawa; kwani nuru nyingine ilikuwa bado iwaangazie kutoka kwenye kiti cha enzi cha Mungu."

They approached this hour with a calm solemnity. They rested in sweet communion with God, an earnest of the peace that was to be theirs in the bright hereafter. None who experienced this hope and trust can forget those precious hours of waiting. Worldly business was for the most part laid aside for a few weeks. Believers carefully examined every thought and emotion of their hearts as if upon their deathbeds and in a few hours to close their eyes upon earthly scenes. There was no making of “ascension robes,” but all felt the need of internal evidence that they were prepared to meet the Saviour; their white robes were purity of soul, characters cleansed from sin by the atoning blood of Christ.",

Yet the Lord had accomplished His purpose: He had tested the hearts of those who had professed to be waiting for His appearing. There were among them many who had been actuated by no higher motive than fear. Their profession of faith had not affected their hearts or their lives. When the expected event failed to take place, these persons declared that they were not disappointed; they had never believed that Christ would come. They were among the first to ridicule the sorrow of the true believers.",
        "But Jesus and all the heavenly host looked with love and sympathy upon the tried and faithful yet disappointed ones. Could the veil separating the visible from the invisible world have been swept back, angels would have been seen drawing near to these steadfast souls and shielding them from the shafts of Satan."

Waliafikia saa hii kwa utulivu na unyenyekevu mkuu. Walipumzika katika ushirika mtamu na Mungu, kionjo cha amani ambayo ingekuwa yao katika maisha yajayo yenye utukufu. Hakuna yeyote aliyepitia tumaini hili na uaminifu huu anayeweza kusahau saa hizo za thamani za kungoja. Shughuli za kidunia kwa kiasi kikubwa ziliwekwa kando kwa wiki chache. Waumini walichunguza kwa makini kila fikira na hisia za mioyo yao kana kwamba wako kwenye vitanda vyao vya mauti na baada ya saa chache wangefunga macho yao kuacha mambo ya duniani. Hakukuwa na utengenezaji wa “makanzu ya kupaa,” lakini wote walihisi hitaji la ushahidi wa ndani kwamba walikuwa tayari kukutana na Mwokozi; kanzu zao nyeupe zilikuwa usafi wa roho, tabia zilizosafishwa dhidi ya dhambi kwa damu ya upatanisho ya Kristo.",

Waadventista hawakugundua kosa hilo, wala halikugunduliwa na wapinzani wao waliosoma sana. Hawa wa mwisho walisema, “Ukokotoaji wenu wa vipindi vya unabii ni sahihi. Tukio fulani kubwa liko karibu kutokea, lakini si lile ambalo Bw. Miller anatabiri; ni kuongoka kwa ulimwengu, na si kuja kwa mara ya pili kwa Kristo.”",

Hata hivyo Bwana alikuwa ametimiza kusudi Lake: Alikuwa ameijaribu mioyo ya wale waliokuwa wamekiri kuwa wanangojea kutokea Kwake. Walikuwepo miongoni mwao wengi ambao walikuwa wakiongozwa na nia isiyo na uzito zaidi ya hofu. Ukiri wao wa imani haukuwa umegusa mioyo yao wala maisha yao. Tukio lililotarajiwa liliposhindwa kutokea, watu hawa walitangaza kwamba hawakukata tamaa; hawakuwahi kuamini kwamba Kristo angekuja. Walikuwa miongoni mwa wa kwanza kudhihaki huzuni ya waumini wa kweli.",
        "Lakini Yesu na jeshi lote la mbinguni walitazama kwa upendo na huruma wale waliojaribiwa na waaminifu, ingawa walikuwa wamekata tamaa. Kama pazia linalotenganisha ulimwengu unaoonekana na usioonekana lingeweza kuondolewa, malaika wangeonekana wakisogea karibu na roho hizi thabiti na kuwakinga dhidi ya mishale ya Shetani."

    "The churches that refused to receive the first angel’s message rejected light from heaven. That message was sent in mercy to arouse them to see their true condition of worldliness and backsliding, and to seek a preparation to meet their Lord. It was to separate the church of Christ from the corrupting influence of the world that the first angel’s message was given. But with the multitude, even of professed Christians, the ties which bound them to earth were stronger than the attractions heavenward. They chose to listen to the voice of worldly wisdom, and turned away from the heart-searching message of truth.",
    "God gives light to be cherished and obeyed, not to be despised and rejected. The light which He sends becomes darkness to those who disregard it. When the Spirit of God ceases to impress the truth upon the hearts of men, all hearing is vain, and all preaching also is vain. When the churches spurned the counsel of God by rejecting the advent message, the Lord rejected them. The first angel was followed by a second, proclaiming, “Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.” Revelation 14:8.",
    "This message was understood by Adventists to be an announcement of the moral fall of the churches in consequence of their rejection of the first message. The proclamation, “Babylon is fallen,” was given in the summer of 1844, and as the result, about fifty thousand withdrew from these churches.",
    "Those who preached the first message had no purpose or expectation of causing divisions in the churches, or of forming separate organizations. “In all my labors,” said William Miller, “I never had the desire or thought to establish any separate interest from that of existing denominations, or to benefit one at the expense of another. I thought to benefit all. My whole object was a desire to convert souls to God, to notify the world of a coming judgment, and to induce my fellow men to make that preparation of heart which will enable them to meet their God in peace.”",
    "For a time many of the churches welcomed his labors, but as they decided against the advent truth, they desired to suppress all agitation of the subject. Those who had accepted the doctrine were thus placed in a position of great trial and perplexity. They loved their churches, and were loth to separate from them; but as they were ridiculed and oppressed, many at last arose and cast off the yoke that had been imposed upon them.",
    "Adventists, seeing that the churches rejected the testimony of God’s Word, could no longer regard them as constituting the church of Christ, “the pillar and ground of the truth;” and as the message, “Babylon is fallen,” began to be proclaimed, they felt themselves justified in separating from their former connection.",
    "Since the rejection of the first message, a sad change has taken place in the churches. As truth is spurned, error is received and cherished. Love for God and faith in His Word have grown cold. The churches have grieved the Spirit of the Lord, and it has been in a great measure withdrawn."

Ilikuwa ni kwa ajili ya kuitenga kanisa la Kristo na ushawishi wa ufisadi wa ulimwengu ndipo ujumbe wa malaika wa kwanza ulitolewa.

Walichagua kusikiliza sauti ya hekima ya kidunia, na wakageuka na kuuacha ujumbe wa ukweli unaochunguza moyo.",

Wakati makanisa yalipokataa shauri la Mungu kwa kuukataa ujumbe wa marejeo, Bwana aliwakataa. Malaika wa kwanza alifuatiwa na wa pili, akitangaza, “Umeanguka, umeanguka Babeli, mji ule ulio mkuu, kwa kuwa umewanywesha mataifa yote divai ya ghadhabu ya uasherati wake.” Ufunuo 14:8.",
    "Ujumbe huu ulieleweka na Waadventista kuwa ni tangazo la anguko la kimaadili la makanisa kama matokeo ya kukataa kwao ujumbe wa kwanza. Tangazo la “Babeli umeanguka,” lilitolewa katika majira ya joto ya mwaka 1844, na kama matokeo, takriban watu elfu hamsini walijiondoa kwenye makanisa hayo.",
    "Wale waliohubiri ujumbe wa kwanza hawakuwa na dhumuni wala mategemeo ya kusababisha migawanyiko katika makanisa, au kuanzisha mashirika tofauti. William Miller alisema, “Katika kazi zangu zote, sijawahi kuwa na hamu au wazo la kuanzisha maslahi yoyote tofauti na yale ya madhehebu yaliyopo, au kumnufaisha mmoja kwa gharama ya mwingine.

Wale waliokuwa wamekubali fundisho hilo walijikuta katika hali ya majaribu makubwa na mkanganyiko. Walipenda makanisa yao, na walikuwa na kusita kujitenga nayo; lakini walipodhihakiwa na kudhulumiwa, wengi hatimaye walisimama na kutupilia mbali nira waliyokuwa wamewekewa.",

    "Tangu kukataliwa kwa ujumbe wa kwanza, mabadiliko ya kusikitisha yametokea katika makanisa. Wakati ukweli unapodhaliwa, kosa hupokelewa na kuthaminiwa. Upendo kwa Mungu na imani katika Neno Lake vimepoa. Makanisa yamemhuzunisha Roho wa Bwana, naye amejiondoa kwa kiasi kikubwa."

    "When the year 1843 entirely passed away unmarked by the advent of Jesus, those who had looked in faith for His appearing were for a time left in doubt and perplexity. But notwithstanding their disappointment, many continued to search the Scriptures, examining anew the evidences of their faith, and carefully studying the prophecies to obtain further light. The Bible testimony in support of their position seemed clear and conclusive. Signs which could not be mistaken pointed to the coming of Christ as near. The believers could not explain their disappointment; yet they felt assured that God had led them in their past experience.",
    "Their faith was greatly strengthened by the direct and forcible application of those scriptures which set forth a tarrying time. As early as 1842, the Spirit of God had moved upon Charles Fitch to devise the prophetic chart, which was generally regarded by Adventists as a fulfillment of the command given by the prophet Habakkuk, to “write the vision, and make it plain upon tables.” No one, however, then saw the tarrying time which was brought to view in the same prophecy. After the disappointment the full meaning of this scripture became apparent. Thus speaks the prophet: “Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it. For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it, because it will surely come, it will not tarry.” Habakkuk 2:2, 3.",
    "The waiting ones rejoiced that He who knows the end from the beginning had looked down through the ages, and, foreseeing their disappointment, had given them words of courage and hope. Had it not been for such portions of Scripture, showing that they were in the right path, their faith would have failed in that trying hour.",
    "In the parable of the ten virgins, Matthew 25, the experience of Adventists is illustrated by the incidents of an Eastern marriage. “Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.” “While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.”",
    "The widespread movement under the proclamation of the first message, answered to the going forth of the virgins, while the passing of the time of expectation, the disappointment, and the delay, were represented by the tarrying of the bridegroom. After the definite time had passed, the true believers were still united in the belief that the end of all things was at hand; but it soon became evident that they were losing, to some extent, their zeal and devotion, and were falling into the state denoted in the parable by the slumbering of the virgins during the tarrying time.",
    "About this time fanaticism began to appear. Some who professed to be zealous believers in the message rejected the Word of God as the one infallible guide, and, claiming to be led by the Spirit, gave themselves up to the control of their own feelings, impressions, and imaginations. There were some who manifested a blind and bigoted zeal, denouncing all who would not sanction their course. Their fanatical ideas and exercises met with no sympathy from the great body of Adventists; yet they served to bring reproach upon the cause of truth.",
    "The preaching of the first message in 1843, and of the midnight cry in 1844, tended directly to repress fanaticism and dissension. Those who participated in these solemn movements were in harmony; their hearts were filled with love for one another, and for Jesus, whom they expected soon to see. The one faith, the one blessed hope, lifted them above the control of any human influence and proved a shield against the assaults of Satan."

    "Wakati mwaka 1843 ulipopita kabisa bila kuonekana kwa kuja kwa Yesu, wale waliokuwa wamengojea kwa imani kutokea Kwake waliachwa kwa muda katika shaka na mkanganyiko. Lakini licha ya kukata tamaa kwao, wengi waliendelea kuchunguza Maandiko, wakichunguza upya ushahidi wa imani yao, na kusoma kwa makini unabii ili kupata nuru zaidi. Ushahidi wa Biblia katika kuunga mkono msimamo wao ulionekana kuwa wazi na wa kuhitimisha. Ishara ambazo hazikuweza kukosewa ziliashiria kuja kwa Kristo kuwa karibu. Waumini hawakuweza kuelezea kukata tamaa kwao; lakini walihisi uhakika kwamba Mungu alikuwa amewaongoza katika uzoefu wao wa huko nyuma.",
    "Imani yao iliimarishwa sana na utumiaji wa moja kwa moja na wenye nguvu wa maandiko hayo ambayo yalionyesha wakati wa kukawia. Mapema mwaka 1842, Roho wa Mungu alikuwa amemwongoza Charles Fitch kubuni chati ya unabii, ambayo kwa ujumla ilichukuliwa na Waadventista kama utimilifu wa amri iliyotolewa na nabii Habakuki, “iandike njozi, ukaifanye iwe wazi katika vibao.” Hakuna mtu, hata hivyo, aliyeona wakati wa kukawia ambao ulionyeshwa katika unabii huo huo wakati huo. Baada ya kukata tamaa, maana kamili ya andiko hili ikawa dhahiri. Nabii asema hivi: “Iandike njozi, ukaifanye iwe wazi katika vibao, ili aisomaye apate kupiga mbio. Kwa maana njozi hii bado ni kwa wakati ulioamriwa, lakini mwishoni itanena, wala haitasema uongo: ijapokawia, ingojee, kwa sababu itakuja bila shaka, haitakawia.” Habakuki 2:2, 3.",
    "Wale waliokuwa wakingoja walifurahi kwamba Yeye ajuaye mwisho tangu mwanzo alikuwa ametazama chini kupitia karne zote, na, akiona mbele kukata tamaa kwao, alikuwa amewapa maneno ya ujasiri na tumaini. Isingekuwa kwa sehemu kama hizo za Maandiko, zikionyesha kwamba walikuwa katika njia sahihi, imani yao ingekuwa imeshindwa katika saa hiyo ya jaribu.",
    "Katika mfano wa wanawali kumi, Mathayo 25, uzoefu wa Waadventista unafananishwa na matukio ya ndoa ya Mashariki. “Ndipo ufalme wa mbinguni utakapofanana na wanawali kumi, waliotwaa taa zao, wakatoka kwenda kumlaki bwana arusi.” “Na bwana arusi alipokawia, wote wakasinzia wakalala usingizi.”",
    "Vuguvugu lililoenea sana chini ya utangazaji wa ujumbe wa kwanza, lililingana na kule kutoka kwa wanawali, wakati kupita kwa muda wa matarajio, kukata tamaa, na kuchelewa, kuliwakilishwa na kukawia kwa bwana arusi. Baada ya muda maalumu kupita, waumini wa kweli walikuwa bado wameungana katika imani kwamba mwisho wa mambo yote ulikuwa karibu; lakini punde ilionekana wazi kwamba walikuwa wakipoteza, kwa kiasi fulani, bidii na ujitoleaji wao, na walikuwa wakianguka katika hali iliyoonyeshwa katika mfano kwa kusinzia kwa wanawali wakati wa kukawia.",
    "Karibu na wakati huu ushabiki ulianza kuonekana. Baadhi ya wale waliojidai kuwa waumini wenye bidii katika ujumbe huo walilikataa Neno la Mungu kama mwongozo pekee usio na makosa, na, wakidai kuongozwa na Roho, walijitoa kwenye udhibiti wa hisia, miguso, na mawazo yao wenyewe. Kulikuwa na wengine walioonyesha bidii ya upofu na ya kishabiki, wakiwashutumu wote ambao hawangeidhinisha mwenendo wao. Mawazo yao ya kishabiki na mazoezi yao hayakupata huruma yoyote kutoka kwa kundi kubwa la Waadventista; lakini yalitumika kuleta shutuma juu ya kazi ya ukweli.",
    "Uhubiri wa ujumbe wa kwanza mnamo 1843, na wa kilio cha usiku wa manane mnamo 1844, ulielekea moja kwa moja kukandamiza ushabiki na mfarakano. Wale walioshiriki katika mivumo hii mizito walikuwa na upatano; mioyo yao ilijawa na upendo mmoja kwa mwingine, na kwa Yesu, ambaye walitarajia kumwona hivi karibu. Imani moja, tumaini moja lililobarikiwa, liliwainua juu ya udhibiti wa ushawishi wowote wa kibinadamu na ikawa ngao dhidi ya mashambulizi ya Shetani."

    "“While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.” Matthew 25:5-7. In the summer of 1844 Adventists discovered the mistake in their former reckoning of the prophetic periods, and settled upon the correct position. The 2300 days of Daniel 8:14, which all believed to extend to the second coming of Christ, had been thought to end in the spring of 1844; but it was now seen that this period extended to the autumn of the same year, and the minds of Adventists were fixed upon this point as the time for the Lord’s appearing.",
    "The proclamation of this time message was another step in the fulfillment of the parable of the marriage, whose application to the experience of Adventists had already been clearly seen. As in the parable the cry was raised at midnight announcing the approach of the bridegroom, so in the fulfillment, midway between the spring of 1844, when it was first supposed that the 2300 days would close, and the autumn of 1844, at which time it was afterward found that they were really to close, such a cry was raised, in the very words of Scripture: “Behold, the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet Him.”",
    "Like a tidal wave the movement swept over the land. From city to city, from village to village, and into remote country places it went, until the waiting people of God were fully aroused. Before this proclamation fanaticism disappeared, like early frost before the rising sun. Believers once more found their position, and hope and courage animated their hearts.",
    "The work was free from those extremes which are ever manifested when there is human excitement without the controlling influence of the Word and Spirit of God. It was similar in character to those seasons of humiliation and returning unto the Lord which among ancient Israel followed messages of reproof from His servants. It bore the characteristics which mark the work of God in every age. There was little ecstatic joy, but rather deep searching of heart, confession of sin, and forsaking of the world. A preparation to meet the Lord was the burden of agonizing spirits. There was persevering prayer and unreserved consecration to God.",
    "The midnight cry was not so much carried by argument, though the Scripture proof was clear and conclusive. There went with it an impelling power that moved the soul. There was no doubt, no questioning. Upon the occasion of Christ’s triumphal entry into Jerusalem, the people who were assembled from all parts of the land to keep the feast, flocked to the Mount of Olives, and as they joined the throng that were escorting Jesus, they caught the inspiration of the hour and helped to swell the shout, “Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord.” Matthew 21:9. In like manner did unbelievers who flocked to the Adventist meetings—some from curiosity, some merely to ridicule—feel the convincing power attending the message, “Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!”",
    "At that time there was faith that brought answers to prayer—faith that had respect to the recompense of reward. Like showers of rain upon the thirsty earth, the Spirit of grace descended upon the earnest seekers. Those who expected soon to stand face to face with their Redeemer felt a solemn joy that was unutterable. The softening, subduing power of the Holy Spirit melted the heart, as wave after wave of the glory of God swept over the faithful, believing ones.",
    "Carefully and solemnly those who received the message came up to the time when they hoped to meet their Lord. Every morning they felt that it was their first duty to secure the evidence of their acceptance with God. Their hearts were closely united, and they prayed much with and for one another. They often met together in secluded places to commune with God, and the voice of intercession ascended to heaven from the fields and groves. The assurance of the Saviour’s approval was more necessary to them than their daily food, and if a cloud darkened their minds, they did not rest until it was swept away. As they felt the witness of pardoning grace, they longed to behold Him whom their souls loved."

    "“Hata bwana arusi alipokawia, wote wakasinzia wakalala usingizi. Lakini usiku wa manane, pakawa na ukelele, Haya, bwana arusi; tokeni mwende kumlaki. Ndipo walipoondoka wanawali wale wote, wakazitengeneza taa zao.” Mathayo 25:5-7. Katika majira ya joto ya mwaka 1844, Waadventista waligundua kosa katika ukokotoaji wao wa awali wa vipindi vya unabii, na kuanza msimamo sahihi. Siku 2300 za Danieli 8:14, ambazo wote waliamini kuwa zinafika hadi kuja kwa mara ya pili kwa Kristo, zilifikiriwa kuisha katika majira ya kuchipua ya mwaka 1844; lakini sasa ilionekana kuwa kipindi hiki kilifika hadi majira ya vuli ya mwaka huohuo, na akili za Waadventista zikaelekezwa kwenye jambo hili kama wakati wa kutokea kwa Bwana.",
    "Utangazaji wa ujumbe huu wa wakati ulikuwa hatua nyingine katika utimilifu wa mfano wa ndoa, ambao matumizi yake katika uzoefu wa Waadventista yalikuwa yameshaonekana wazi. Kama ilivyokuwa katika mfano ukelele ulipigwa usiku wa manane ukitangaza kukaribia kwa bwana arusi, vivyo hivyo katika utimilifu, katikati ya majira ya kuchipua ya 1844 (wakati ilipodhaniwa awali kuwa siku 2300 zingeisha) na majira ya vuli ya 1844 (wakati ambao baadaye ilionekana kuwa ndipo zingeisha hasa), ukelele kama huo ulipigwa, kwa maneno yaleyale ya Maandiko: “Haya, bwana arusi; tokeni mwende kumlaki!”",
    "Kama wimbi kubwa la maji, vuguvugu hilo lilivuma nchi nzima. Kutoka mji hadi mji, kijiji hadi kijiji, na hadi sehemu za mashambani za mbali lilienea, hadi watu wa Mungu waliokuwa wakingoja waliamshwa kikamilifu. Mbele ya tangazo hili ushabiki ulitoweka, kama umande wa asubuhi mbele ya jua linalochomoza. Waumini walipata tena msimamo wao, na tumaini na ujasiri vilihuisha mioyo yao.",
    "Kazi hiyo ilikuwa huru kutokana na yale mambo ya kupita kiasi ambayo hujidhihirisha kila mara kunapokuwa na msisimko wa kibinadamu bila ushawishi unaodhibiti wa Neno na Roho wa Mungu. Ilifanana katika tabia na nyakati zile za unyenyekevu na kurudi kwa Bwana ambazo miongoni mwa Israeli wa kale zilifuata jumbe za karipio kutoka kwa watumishi Wake. Ilibeba sifa zinazozingatia kazi ya Mungu katika kila kizazi. Kulikuwa na furaha kidogo ya msisimko, bali kulikuwa na uchunguzi wa kina wa moyo, ungamo la dhambi, na kuuacha ulimwengu. Maandalizi ya kukutana na Bwana ndiyo yalikuwa mzigo wa roho zilizokuwa katika juhudi kuu. Kulikuwa na maombi ya kudumu na kujiweka wakfu kwa Mungu bila kubakiza kitu.",
    "Kilio cha usiku wa manane hakikubebwa sana na hoja, ingawa ushahidi wa Maandiko ulikuwa wazi na wa kuhitimisha. Pamoja nacho kulikuwa na nguvu inayolazimisha iliyotikisa nafsi. Hakukuwa na shaka, wala maswali. Wakati wa kuingia kwa ushindi kwa Kristo Yerusalemu, watu waliokusanyika kutoka sehemu zote za nchi kuadhimisha sikukuu, walimiminika kwenye Mlima wa Mizeituni, na walipojiunga na umati uliokuwa ukimsindikiza Yesu, walipokea msukumo wa saa ile na kusaidia kuongeza sauti ya ukelele, “Amebarikiwa Yeye ajaye kwa jina la Bwana.” Mathayo 21:9. Vivyo hivyo, wasioamini waliofurika katika mikutano ya Waadventista—wengine kwa udadisi, wengine ili kudhihaki tu—walihisi nguvu ya kusadikisha iliyoambatana na ujumbe, “Haya, bwana arusi!”",
    "Wakati huo kulikuwa na imani iliyoleta majibu ya maombi—imani iliyozingatia malipo ya thawabu. Kama manyunyu ya mvua juu ya nchi yenye kiu, Roho wa neema alishuka juu ya watafutaji wa dhati. Wale waliotarajia kusimama uso kwa uso na Mkombozi wao hivi karibu walihisi furaha nzito isiyoweza kutamkwa. Nguvu ya Roho Mtakatifu ya kulainisha na kunyenyekeza iliyeyusha moyo, wakati wimbi baada ya wimbi la utukufu wa Mungu likipita juu ya wale waaminifu, wanaoamini.",
    "Kwa uangalifu na unyenyekevu, wale walioupokea ujumbe walikaribia wakati ambao walitegemea kukutana na Bwana wao. Kila asubuhi walihisi kuwa wajibu wao wa kwanza ulikuwa kupata ushahidi wa kukubalika kwao na Mungu. Mioyo yao iliunganishwa kwa karibu, na waliomba sana pamoja na kwa ajili ya mmoja na mwingine. Mara nyingi walikutana pamoja katika sehemu za faragha ili kuzungumza na Mungu, na sauti ya maombezi ilipanda mbinguni kutoka mashambani na vichakani. Uhakika wa kibali cha Mwokozi ulikuwa wa lazima kwao kuliko chakula chao cha kila siku, na ikiwa wingu lilitia giza akili zao, hawakupumzika hadi lilipoondolewa. Walipohisi ushuhuda wa neema inayosamehe, walitamani sana kumwona Yeye ambaye nafsi zao zilimpenda."

    "But again they were destined to disappointment. The time of expectation passed, and their Saviour did not appear. With unwavering confidence they had looked forward to His coming, and now they felt as did Mary, when, coming to the Saviour’s tomb and finding it empty, she exclaimed with weeping, “They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him.” John 20:13.",
    "A feeling of awe, a fear that the message might be true, had for a time served as a restraint upon the unbelieving world. After the passing of the time this did not at once disappear; they dared not triumph over the disappointed ones, but as no tokens of God’s wrath were seen, they recovered from their fears and resumed their reproach and ridicule. A large class who had professed to believe in the Lord’s soon coming renounced their faith. Some who had been very confident were so deeply wounded in their pride that they felt like fleeing from the world. Like Jonah, they complained of God, and chose death rather than life.",
    "Those who had based their faith upon the opinions of others, and not upon the Word of God, were now as ready to again exchange their views. The scoffers won the weak and cowardly to their ranks, and all united in declaring that there could be no more fears or expectations now. The time had passed, the Lord had not come, and the world might remain the same for thousands of years.",
    "The earnest, sincere believers had given up all for Christ, and had shared His presence as never before. They had, as they believed, given their last warning to the world, and, expecting soon to be received into the society of their divine Master and the heavenly angels, they had, to a great extent, withdrawn from the unbelieving multitude. With intense desire they had prayed, “Come, Lord Jesus, and come quickly.” But He had not come. And now to take up again the heavy burden of life’s cares and perplexities, and to endure the taunts and sneers of a scoffing world, was indeed a terrible trial of faith and patience.",
    "Yet this disappointment was not so great as was that experienced by the disciples at the time of Christ’s first advent. When Jesus rode triumphantly into Jerusalem, His followers believed that He was about to ascend the throne of David and deliver Israel from her oppressors. With high hopes and joyful anticipations they vied with one another in showing honor to their King. Many spread out their garments as a carpet in His path, or strewed before Him the leafy branches of the palm. In their enthusiastic joy they united in the glad acclaim, “Hosanna to the Son of David!”",
    "When the Pharisees, disturbed and angered by this outburst of rejoicing, wished Jesus to rebuke His disciples, He replied, “If these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.” Luke 19:40. Prophecy must be fulfilled. The disciples were accomplishing the purpose of God; yet they were doomed to a bitter disappointment. But a few days had passed ere they witnessed the Saviour’s agonizing death and laid Him in the tomb. Their expectations had not been realized in a single particular, and their hopes died with Jesus. Not till their Lord had come forth triumphant from the grave could they perceive that all had been foretold by prophecy, and “that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead.” Acts 17:3.",
    "In like manner was prophecy fulfilled in the first and second angels’ messages. They were given at the right time and accomplished the work which God designed to accomplish by them. The world had been looking on, expecting that if the time passed and Christ did not appear, the whole system of adventism would be given up. But while many, under strong temptation, yielded their faith, there were some who stood firm. They could detect no error in their reckoning of the prophetic periods. The ablest of their opponents had not succeeded in overthrowing their position. True, there had been a failure as to the expected event, but even this could not shake their faith in the Word of God.",
    "God did not forsake His people; His Spirit still abode with those who did not rashly deny the light which they had received, and denounce the advent movement. The apostle Paul, looking down through the ages, had written words of encouragement and warning for the tried, waiting ones at this crisis: “Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise. For yet a little while, and He that shall come will come, and will not tarry. Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, My soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.” Hebrews 10:35-39.",
    "Their only safe course was to cherish the light which they had already received of God, hold fast to His promises, and continue to search the Scriptures, and patiently wait and watch to receive further light."

    "Lakini tena walikuwa wamekusudiwa kukatishwa tamaa. Wakati wa matarajio ulipita, na Mwokozi wao hakutokea. Kwa ujasiri usioyumbayumba walikuwa wamengojekea kuja Kwake, na sasa walihisi kama Mariamu alivyohisi, alipofika kwenye kaburi la Mwokozi na kulikuta tupu, alilia akisema, “Wamemwondoa Bwana wangu, wala mimi sijui walikomweka.” Yohana 20:13.",
    "Hisia ya hofu kuu, hofu kwamba ujumbe ule ungeweza kuwa wa kweli, kwa muda fulani ilikuwa imetumika kama kizuizi kwa ulimwengu usioamini. Baada ya kupita kwa wakati huo, hali hii haikutoweka mara moja; hawakuthubutu kuwakebehi wale waliokata tamaa, lakini kwa kuwa hakuna ishara za ghadhabu ya Mungu zilizonekana, walipona hofu zao na kuanza tena shutuma na dhihaka zao. Kundi kubwa la watu waliokiri kuamini kuja kwa Bwana hivi karibuni walikana imani yao. Baadhi ya wale waliokuwa na uhakika mkubwa walijeruhiwa vibaya katika kiburi chao kiasi kwamba walihisi kama kukimbia ulimwengu. Kama Yona, walimnung’unikia Mungu, na kuchagua kifo badala ya uzima.",
    "Wale waliokuwa wameweka msingi wa imani yao juu ya maoni ya wengine, na si juu ya Neno la Mungu, sasa walikuwa tayari kubadilisha tena mitazamo yao. Wadhihaki walivuta watu dhaifu na waoga kwenye safu zao, na wote waliungana kutangaza kwamba hakuwezi kuwa na hofu au matarajio tena sasa. Wakati ulikuwa umepita, Bwana hakuja, na ulimwengu ungeweza kubaki vilevile kwa maelfu ya miaka.",
    "Waumini wa dhati na wa kweli walikuwa wameacha vyote kwa ajili ya Kristo, na walikuwa wameshiriki uwepo Wake kuliko wakati mwingine wowote. Walikuwa, kama walivyoamini, wametoa onyo lao la mwisho kwa ulimwengu, na wakitarajia kupokelewa hivi karibuni katika ushirika wa Bwana wao wa kimungu na malaika wa mbinguni, walikuwa, kwa kiasi kikubwa, wamejitenga na umati usioamini. Kwa hamu kubwa walikuwa wameomba, “Njoo, Bwana Yesu, na uje upesi.” Lakini hakuja. Na sasa kuanza tena kubeba mzigo mzito wa mahangaiko na mikanganyiko ya maisha, na kuvumilia dhihaka na kashfa za ulimwengu unaodhihaki, kwa kweli lilikuwa jaribu la kutisha la imani na uvumilivu.",
    "Hata hivyo kukata tamaa huku hakukuwa kukubwa kama kule walikopitia wanafunzi wakati wa kuja kwa mara ya kwanza kwa Kristo. Wakati Yesu alipoingia Yerusalemu kwa ushindi, wafuasi Wake waliamini kwamba alikuwa karibu kuketi kwenye kiti cha enzi cha Daudi na kuikomboa Israeli kutoka kwa watesi wake. Kwa matumaini makubwa na matarajio ya furaha walishindana wao kwa wao katika kumheshimu Mfalme wao. Wengi walitandaza nguo zao kama zulia njiani Mwake, au kutandaza mbele Yake matawi ya mitende. Katika furaha yao ya shauku waliungana katika kelele za furaha, “Hosana kwa Mwana wa Daudi!”",
    "Wakati Mafarisayo, wakisumbuliwa na kukasirishwa na mlipuko huu wa furaha, walipotaka Yesu awakemee wanafunzi Wake, Alijibu, “Hawa wakinyamaza, mawe haya yatapiga kelele mara.” Luka 19:40. Unabii ulipaswa kutimia. Wanafunzi walikuwa wakitunza kusudi la Mungu; lakini walikuwa wamehukumiwa kukatishwa tamaa chungu. Lakini siku chache tu zilipita kabla ya kushuhudia kifo cha uchungu cha Mwokozi na kumweka kaburini. Matarajio yao hayakuwa yametimia hata katika jambo moja, na matumaini yao yalikufa pamoja na Yesu. Haikuwa mpaka Bwana wao alipotoka kwa ushindi kutoka kaburini ndipo walipoweza kutambua kwamba yote yalikuwa yametabiriwa na unabii, na “kwamba ilimpasa Kristo kuteswa, na kufufuka katika wafu.” Matendo 17:3.",
    "Vivyo hivyo, unabii ulitimizwa katika jumbe za malaika wa kwanza na wa pili. Zilitolewa kwa wakati unaofaa na zilikamilisha kazi ambayo Mungu alikusudia kuikamilisha kupitia hizo. Ulimwengu ulikuwa ukitazama, ukitarajia kwamba ikiwa wakati ungepita na Kristo asitokee, mfumo mzima wa Uadventista ungeachwa. Lakini wakati wengi, chini ya majaribu makali, walisalimisha imani yao, kulikuwa na baadhi waliosimama imara. Hawakuweza kugundua kosa lolote katika ukokotoaji wao wa vipindi vya unabii. Wapinzani wao stadi zaidi walikuwa hawajafanikiwa kupindua msimamo wao. Ni kweli, kulikuwa na kushindwa kwa lile tukio lililotarajiwa, lakini hata hili lisingeweza kutikisa imani yao katika Neno la Mungu.",
    "Mungu hakuwaacha watu Wake; Roho Wake bado alikaa na wale ambao hawakukana kwa haraka nuru waliyokuwa wameipokea, na kusingizia vuguvugu la marejeo. Mtume Paulo, akitazama mbele kupitia karne zote, alikuwa ameandika maneno ya kutia moyo na onyo kwa wale waliojaribiwa, wakingoja katika mgogoro huu: “Basi msiutupe ujasiri wenu, kwa maana una thawabu kuu. Kwa maana mnahitaji saburi, ili kwamba, mkiisha kuyafanya mapenzi ya Mungu, mpate ile ahadi. Kwa kuwa bado kitambo kidogo sana, Yeye ajaye atakuja, wala hatakawia. Lakini mwenye haki wangu ataishi kwa imani; naye akisita-sita, roho yangu haina furaha naye. Lakini sisi hatumo miongoni mwao wasita-sitao na kupotea, bali tumo miongoni mwa walio na imani ya kutuokoa roho zetu.” Waebrania 10:35-39.",
    "Njia yao pekee ya salama ilikuwa kuthamini nuru ambayo walikuwa tayari wameipokea kutoka kwa Mungu, kushikilia ahadi Zake, na kuendelea kuchunguza Maandiko, na kungoja na kukesha kwa uvumilivu ili kupokea nuru zaidi."

    "The scripture which above all others had been both the foundation and central pillar of the advent faith was the declaration, “Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.” Daniel 8:14. These had been familiar words to all believers in the Lord’s soon coming. By the lips of thousands was this prophecy joyfully repeated as the watchword of their faith. All felt that upon the events therein brought to view depended their brightest expectations and most cherished hopes.",
    "These prophetic days had been shown to terminate in the autumn of 1844. In common with the rest of the Christian world, Adventists then held that the earth, or some portion of it, was the sanctuary, and that the cleansing of the sanctuary was the purification of the earth by the fires of the last great day. This they understood would take place at the second coming of Christ. Hence the conclusion that Christ would return to the earth in 1844.",
    "But the appointed time came, and the Lord did not appear. The believers knew that God’s Word could not fail; their interpretation of the prophecy must be at fault; but where was the mistake? Many rashly cut the knot of difficulty by denying that the 2300 days ended in 1844. No reason could be given for this position, except that Christ had not come at the time of expectation.",
    "They argued that if the prophetic days had ended in 1844, Christ would then have come to cleanse the sanctuary by the purification of the earth by fire; and that since He had not come, the days could not have ended.",
    "Though the majority of Adventists abandoned their former reckoning of the prophetic periods, and consequently denied the correctness of the movement based thereon, a few were unwilling to renounce points of faith and experience that were sustained by the Scriptures and by the special witness of the Spirit of God. They believed that they had adopted sound principles of interpretation in their study of the Scriptures, and that it was their duty to hold fast the truths already gained, and to still pursue the same course of Biblical research. With earnest prayer they reviewed their position, and studied the Scriptures to discover their mistake. As they could see no error in their explanation of the prophetic periods, they were led to examine more closely the subject of the sanctuary."

Haya yalikuwa maneno yaliyozoeleka kwa waumini wote wa kuja kwa Bwana upesi. Kupitia vinywa vya maelfu, unabii huu ulikaririwa kwa furaha kama neno la siri la imani yao. Wote walihisi kuwa matukio yaliyoonyeshwa humo ndimo yalitegemea matarajio yao angavu zaidi na matumaini yao waliyoyathamini sana.",
    "Siku hizi za unabii zilikuwa zimeonyeshwa kuishia katika majira ya vuli ya mwaka 1844. Pamoja na ulimwengu wote wa Kikristo, Waadventista wakati huo waliamini kuwa dunia, au sehemu fulani ya dunia, ndiyo lilikuwa patakatifu, na kwamba kutakaswa kwa patakatifu kulikuwa ni kutakaswa kwa dunia kwa moto wa siku kuu ya mwisho. Walielewa kuwa jambo hili lingetokea wakati wa kuja kwa mara ya pili kwa Kristo. Hivyo basi, wakafikia hitimisho kuwa Kristo angerudi duniani mnamo 1844.",
    "Lakini wakati uliowekwa ulifika, na Bwana hakutokea. Waumini walijua kuwa Neno la Mungu haliwezi kushindwa; tafsiri yao ya unabii lazima ilikuwa na makosa; lakini kosa lilikuwa wapi? Wengi kwa haraka walikata fundo la ugumu huo kwa kukanusha kuwa siku 2300 ziliisha mnamo 1844. Hakuna sababu iliyoweza kutolewa kwa msimamo huo, isipokuwa tu kwamba Kristo hakuja wakati wa matarajio.",
    "Walidai kuwa kama siku za unabii zingeisha mnamo 1844, Kristo angekuja wakati huo kutakasa patakatifu kwa kuitakasa dunia kwa moto; na kwa kuwa Hakuja, basi siku hizo zisingeweza kuwa zimeisha.",
    "Ingawa idadi kubwa ya Waadventista waliacha ukokotoaji wao wa awali wa vipindi vya unabii, na hivyo kukanusha usahihi wa vuguvugu lililojengwa juu yake, wachache hawakuwa tayari kukana vipengele vya imani na uzoefu ambao ulitegemezwa na Maandiko na ushuhuda maalum wa Roho wa Mungu. Waliamini kuwa walikuwa wamefuata kanuni thabiti za tafsiri katika kujifunza kwao Maandiko, na kwamba ulikuwa wajibu wao kushikilia sana kweli ambazo tayari walikuwa wamezipata, na kuendelea na mkondo uleule wa utafiti wa Biblia. Kwa maombi ya dhati walipitia upya msimamo wao, na kujifunza Maandiko ili kugundua kosa lao. Kwa kuwa hawakuona kosa lolote katika maelezo yao ya vipindi vya unabii, waliongozwa kuchunguza kwa ukaribu zaidi somo la patakatifu."

    "In their investigation they learned that the earthly sanctuary, built by Moses at the command of God according to the pattern shown him in the mount, was “a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices”; that its two holy places were “patterns of things in the heavens”; that Christ, our great High Priest, is “a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man”; that “Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.” Hebrews 9:9, 23; 8:2; Hebrews 9:24.",
    "The sanctuary in heaven, in which Jesus ministers in our behalf, is the great original, of which the sanctuary built by Moses was a copy. As the sanctuary on earth had two apartments, the holy and the most holy, so there are two holy places in the sanctuary in heaven. And the ark containing the law of God, the altar of incense, and other instruments of service found in the sanctuary below, have also their counterpart in the sanctuary above. In holy vision the apostle John was permitted to enter heaven, and he there beheld the candlestick and the altar of incense, and as “the temple of God was opened,” he beheld also “the ark of His testament.” Revelation 4:5; 8:3; Revelation 11:19.",
    "Those who were seeking for the truth found indisputable proof of the existence of a sanctuary in heaven. Moses made the earthly sanctuary after a pattern which was shown him. Paul declared that that pattern was the true sanctuary which is in heaven. (Hebrews 8:2, 5.) John testified that he saw it in heaven.",
    "At the termination of the 2300 days, in 1844, no sanctuary had existed on earth for many centuries; therefore the sanctuary in heaven must be the one brought to view in the declaration, “Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.” But how could the sanctuary in heaven need cleansing? Turning again to the Scriptures, the students of prophecy learned that the cleansing was not a removal of physical impurities, for it was to be accomplished with blood, and therefore must be a cleansing from sin. Thus says the apostle: “It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these [the blood of animals]; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these [even the precious blood of Christ].” Hebrews 9:23."

Na sanduku lenye sheria ya Mungu, madhabahu ya kufukizia uvumba, na vyombo vingine vya huduma vilivyopatikana katika patakatifu pa chini, pia vina mfano wake katika patakatifu pa juu. Katika maono matakatifu mtume Yohana aliruhusiwa kuingia mbinguni, na huko aliona kinara cha taa na madhabahu ya uvumba, na wakati “hekalu la Mungu lilipofunguliwa,” aliona pia “sanduku la agano lake.” Ufunuo 4:5; 8:3; 11:19.",
    "Wale waliokuwa wakitafuta ukweli walipata ushahidi usiopingika wa kuwepo kwa patakatifu mbinguni. Musa alitengeneza patakatifu pa duniani kwa kufuata mfano alioonyeshwa. Paulo alitangaza kwamba mfano huo ulikuwa patakatifu pa kweli palipo mbinguni. (Waebrania 8:2, 5.) Yohana alishuhudia kwamba alipaona mbinguni.",
    "Mwishoni mwa zile siku 2300, mnamo 1844, hapakuwa na patakatifu duniani kwa karne nyingi; kwa hivyo patakatifu pa mbinguni lazima ndipo palipoonyeshwa katika lile tamko, “Hata jioni na asubuhi elfu mbili na mia tatu; ndipo patakatifu patapotakasika.” Lakini patakatifu pa mbinguni pangewezaje kuhitaji kutakaswa? Wakirudi tena kwenye Maandiko, wanafunzi wa unabii walijifunza kwamba kutakaswa huko hakukuwa kuondolewa kwa uchafu wa kimwili, kwa maana kulipaswa kutimizwa kwa damu, na kwa hivyo lazima kuwe ni kutakaswa kwa dhambi. Hivyo ndivyo asemavyo mtume: “Basi ilikuwa lazima mifano ya mambo yaliyo mbinguni isafishwe kwa hayo [damu ya wanyama]; lakini mambo ya mbinguni yenyewe yasafishwe kwa dhabihu zilizo bora kuliko hizo [hata damu ya thamani ya Kristo].” Waebrania 9:23."

And as the typical cleansing of the earthly was accomplished by the removal of the sins by which it had been polluted, so the actual cleansing of the heavenly is to be accomplished by the removal, or blotting out, of the sins which are there recorded.",
    "This necessitates an examination of the books of record to determine who, through repentance of sin and faith in Christ, are entitled to the benefits of His atonement.

Kwa hivyo, kutakaswa kwa patakatifu kunahusisha kazi ya hukumu ya upelelezi. Kazi hii lazima ifanyike kabla ya kuja kwa Kristo kuwakomboa watu Wake, kwa maana Atakapokuja, ijara Yake i pamoja Naye kumlipa kila mtu kama kazi yake ilivyo. (Ufunuo 22:12.)",
